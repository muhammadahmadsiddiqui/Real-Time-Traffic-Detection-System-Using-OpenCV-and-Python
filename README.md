# Vehicle Counting and Lane Detection using OpenCV

This project detects vehicles in two lanes of a video feed, counts them, and tracks their movement across predefined lines using OpenCV. It applies background subtraction, contour detection, and object tracking techniques to identify vehicles and count them based on their positions in the lanes.

## Features

- Detects vehicles moving in two lanes.
- Counts vehicles that cross a predefined line in each lane.
- Visualizes vehicle detection and counting on video feed.
- Displays real-time vehicle count on the screen.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

### Install dependencies:

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
